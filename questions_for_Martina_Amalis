1. Shall we include Cultus Lake, even though it's not in the ZQM Model Output?

2. If we include level 2 priority waterbodies (from ZQM Model), then we 
are including Cultus Lake (also, N of lakes goes up from 15 to 137). If 
we include these, we could only include waterbodies that overlap
with SARA / Sockeye / Critical Habitat.
